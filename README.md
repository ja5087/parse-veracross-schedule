#parse-veracross-schedule

A very hacky attempt to parse the Veracross schedule for NIST Students into JSON Form (and XML in the future) so it can be used for other applications.


##Running
1. Run index.html
2. Place text in box
3. Mouse pointer on button and click. Result should be formatted JSON.


##bugs i know already and TODOs in order of importance
1. Some of the fields aren't filled in properly e.g. some still undefined and unknown
2. Doesn't work across all schedules (this is by the hacky nature of it)
3. add XML output
4. add download options

##uses
1. Integrate into app to read a schedule.
